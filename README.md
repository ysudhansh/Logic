# Logic
Personal assistant coded up on Python 3.7

This bot uses speech recognition to detect and execute some basic commands.

The following modules were used:
1. SpeechRecogntion
2. os
3. re
4. wikipedia
5. webbrowser
6. sys
7. requests
8. subprocess
9. pyowm
10. bs4
11. time
12. requests_xml

Install any missing modules to be able to run the bot by typing the following in your terminal:
pip3 install <module_name>

Advice : Create a virtual environment (venv) to run the code by entering the following in your terminal before installing any of the above modules : python3 -m venv <venv_name>. Activate the venv using this : source <venv_name>/bin/activate. Install all necessary modules and run the code.

Google all other problems.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
